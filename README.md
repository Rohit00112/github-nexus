3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Authentication

GitHub Nexus uses GitHub OAuth for authentication. When you first access the application, you'll be prompted to sign in with your GitHub account and authorize the application to access your repositories, issues, pull requests, and workflows.

## Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy GitHub Nexus is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com):

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Import the project to Vercel
3. Add the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

### Docker Deployment

You can also deploy GitHub Nexus using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t github-nexus .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id -e GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret -e NEXTAUTH_URL=your_url github-nexus
```
